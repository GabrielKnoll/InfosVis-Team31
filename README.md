# InfoVis | Team 31
In Milestone 01, we identified the impact of the corona lockdown measures on the food service industry.
To visualize this impact, we answer two questions in our visualization:
- How has the number of food service establishments per state changed and what have been the revenue losses due to the pandemic? 
- What does the decline look like for full- and part-time employees? 

For our project we use vanilla HTML, CSS, JS, and D3.js for our visualizations.
